# Server Settings

Representing `server.toml`

## Server Address

The address to bind the server to.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
bind = "0.0.0.0:25565"
```
:::

## Welcome Message

Welcome message displayed to players after joining.
Supports [MiniMessage formatting](/customization/message-formatting.html) for colors and styling.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = "<green>Welcome to <bold>PicoLimbo</bold>!</green>"
```
:::

You can also use legacy color codes for backward compatibility:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = "§aWelcome to PicoLimbo!"
```
:::

Welcome message can be disabled by setting an empty string:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = ""
```
:::


## Default Gamemode

The default game mode for players.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
default_game_mode = "spectator"
```
:::

Possible values:
```
survival
creative
adventure
spectator
```

> [!NOTE]
> For Minecraft versions 1.7.x, the spectator game mode does not exist. If you set `default_game_mode = "spectator"`, it will spawn players in "creative" mode instead.

## Hardcore

Spawns the player in hardcore mode.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
hardcore = true
```
:::

## Fetch Player Skins

Set to true to fetch the player skin textures from Mojang API.  
If set to false, the server will still send the skins if the limbo server is running behind a proxy in online mode.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
fetch_player_skins = true
```
:::

> [!WARNING]
> If you expect a large amount of player to connect to your limbo server instance, your server's IP may get black listed from Mojang API.
